        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This custard recipe is a combination of a few different recipes I've tried. 
        It's not too rich or too sweet as many egg custards can be.
        Can be served warm immediately or cold.</p>


        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>Â½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Gather all ingredients.</li>

            <li>Step 2: Place milk, vanilla extract, and butter in a saucepan.</li>

            <li>Step 3: Cook and stir over medium heat until simmering; remove from heat before it comes to a boil.</li>
            <li>Step 4: Whisk eggs, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl until sugar dissolves.</li>

            <li>Step 5: Set the saucepan back over low heat. Pour in egg mixture slowly, whisking constantly, 
                        until custard thickens enough to coat the bottom of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>

            <li>Step 6: Serve warm or transfer custard into a large bowl and cover. </li>
            
            <li>Step 7: Allow to cool before chilling. Enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
